## Where is the download?
  [Download](https://github.com/o5u3/Roblox-Font-Changer/releases)

## Will RoFont cause issues with my device?
  No, this only focuses on the Roblox directory and the folder with RoFont.

## Will this work with Bloxstrap?
  Yes, if you wanted to change your Roblox font for the NORMAL Roblox you would have to uninstall Bloxstrap. However, Bloxstrap already has this feature so RoFont is mainly intended for the normal Roblox client.
